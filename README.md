### Deep Learning Live Project

#### Project outline
The project is broken into 6 parts.

1. Setting up the Google Colab Notebook
2. Collecting and Cleaning Data
3. Create a Neural Netwok
4. Common Training Errors
5. Hyper Parameter Tuning
6. Deploying a Trained Network

#### Prerequisites
The liveProject is for beginner or intermediate Python programmers with a desire to pick up some data science.

TOOLS
1. Basics of Python
2. Basics of pandas
4. 3. Basics of Google Colab
5. Basics of TensorFlow and Keras

TECHNIQUES
Basics of machine learning

#### Python libraries and setup
The liveProject will be taught with the expectation that you are running a Google Colab notebook. But if you want to use a Jupyter Notebook or another Python IDE, that is fine as well. I will list the major libraries below, but we are using the default of what comes with Google Colab.

Python: Version 3.6.

TensorFlow: Version 2.2.

We will be using the default version 2.2 but anything over version 2 will work. There was a major rewrite for v2 that introduced eager execution as well as rolling in Keras.
pandas: Version 1.0.3.

Matplotlib: Version 3.2.1.
